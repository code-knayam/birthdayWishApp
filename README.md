# Facebook Birthday Wish App

Replying to all the posts on a birthday can be a tedious task.
This is an automated program on pyhton to reply to those messages either all at once or one by once.

You can customize the messages to be replied with by changing by "message_list" array.

Prerequisite - \n
    -> Need python on your system \n
    -> Need to have Facebook Graph API Explorer Token, with proper permissions.\n
        If you dont have, get one from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer \n
    -> And the last, your birthday date ;) ;) \n

Just run the index.py, python file and your job will be done if you provide necessary inputs.
